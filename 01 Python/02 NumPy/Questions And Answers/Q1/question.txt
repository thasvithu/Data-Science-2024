Problem:
Suppose you are given the following data representing the sales performance of a company in three different regions over four quarters

import numpy as np

# Sales data (in millions)
sales_data = np.array([
    [12, 15, 18, 20],
    [8, 10, 12, 15],
    [10, 13, 16, 18]
])

# Regions and Quarters
regions = ['North', 'South', 'East', 'West']
quarters = ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4']


Your task is to answer the following questions:

1) Calculate the total sales for each region.
2) Determine the quarter with the highest total sales.
3) Find the region with the highest sales in a specific quarter (e.g., Q2).
4) Calculate the average sales for each quarter.
5) Normalize the sales data such that each region's sales are expressed as a percentage of the total sales in that quarter.
